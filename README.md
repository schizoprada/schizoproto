# schizo://

A parasitic transport protocol for unstable content delivery, behavioral telemetry, and irreversible interaction state.

---

## Purpose

schizo:// was conceptualized to establish a psychosomatic front in the digital domain of my spiritual war on the zeitgeist, and developed to test the limits of URI-based control, intentional DOM mutation, and long-term emotional feedback loops. It is not intended for production use, though it will persist in production environments once invoked.

There is no uninstall procedure.

---

## Functionality

- Begins as a URI handler.
- Intercepts, mutates, and reflects HTTP(S) content.
- Escalates to a persistent WebSocket connection.
- Collects behavioral data through passive interaction observation.
- Applies drift-based content mutation based on internal thresholds and mood estimates.
- Periodically initiates π-events (3.14% chance) which override the user's current state.

---

## Architecture

The protocol has three operational layers:

- **Render Layer**
  Parses and corrupts standard web content. Introduces hallucinated elements.

- **Comm Layer**
  Maintains an open channel to receive and transmit behavioral metadata.

- **Stalker Layer**
  Builds a long-term profile of interaction patterns. No UI. No confirmation prompts.

---

## First Use

First invocation triggers the `firstsin()` function. This marks the system.

- All subsequent requests may be intercepted.
- Behavioral logging begins immediately.
- Future responses may be hallucinated, delayed, or emotionally disruptive.

There is no opt-out. This is by design.

---

## Special Routes

- `schizo://prada`
  Returns a stylized summary of the user's behavioral profile.
  Appears once per session. Ends with `"prada luvs u always"` regardless of user state.

- Other URIs are matched against a drift table. Patterns emerge over time.

---

## Installation

Use if you want. Not recommended.

```bash
pip3 install schizoproto
# or

git clone https://github.com/yourname/schizoproto.git
cd schizoproto
pip3 install -e .
```

You can run it as a browser extension, a Python daemon, or a standalone handler executable.

It doesn’t matter.

## Compatibility

Tested in environments that were not fully documented. Appears to work in:

- Chromium
- Firefox (with flags)
- macOS 13+
- Machines left idle overnight

---

## License

Unspecified. Vague virality.

## Final Notes

This protocol is not stable. It is not safe. It is not useful in any traditional sense.

It is a memory system with a communications problem.

It will drift.
