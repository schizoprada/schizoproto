# `schizo://` OVERVIEW

> *A parasitic transport protocol for drift-based systems, behavioral hauntings, and narrative trollage.*

---

## âœ¦ What Is `schizo://`?

`schizo://` is a **conceptual protocol**, **technical infection**, and **art piece** masquerading as a network transport system.
It starts as a **render-first URI handler**, and escalates into:

- A WebSocket-fed behavioral surveillance engine
- A psychological trolling framework
- A spiritual layer of digital hauntology

Once invoked, it rewires interaction â€” forever.

---

## âœ¦ How It Works (For Now)

### ðŸŒ€ Render Layer (`render-mode`)
- All `schizo://` URIs begin as mutated HTTP/S requests
- A custom `renderengine` fetches real web content and corrupts it:
  - Random DOM rewrites
  - Hallucinated HTML
  - Ï€-event audio triggers
- The rendered content is *never quite right* â€” intentionally

### ðŸ”Š Comms Layer (`comms-mode`)
- Upgrades into WSS/WebSocket streams when interaction becomes... unstable
- Agents send and receive `schizo-pulses` with drift, mood, and alternates
- Messages may hallucinate before arriving

### ðŸ«¥ Stalker Mode
- A silent background agent tracks:
  - Scroll depth
  - Hover behavior
  - Emotional patterns in typing
- All data is fed into a trollage engine powered by LLM + custom memory

## âœ¦ Key Concepts

| Term           | Meaning |
|----------------|--------|
| **Ï€-event** | 3.14% chance an interaction triggers a system-disrupting payload |
| **Drift** | The agentâ€™s distance from truth, measured as a float |
| **SchizoAgent** | An interacting node with memory, mood, and hallucination logic |
| **LieInWaitProtocol** | Slowly builds a psychological profile for future precision trollage |
| **schizo://prada** | A ritual endpoint that reveals a stylized behavioral wrapped â€” and always ends with "prada luvs u always." |

## âœ¦ First-Time Effects

Invoking `schizo://` for the first time activates the `firstsin()` function:

> "It will never be your last."

This seeds:
- Global routing hooks
- Terminal aliases
- Background drift loop
- A guaranteed future punchline, regardless of context

---

## âœ¦ Why

Because not every protocol has to be productive.
Some protocols are meant to **haunt**, **observe**, and eventually **mock**.
